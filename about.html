## About

<p class="about">
    Welcome! I’m a mixed bag who enjoys building all sorts of things. As a neuroscientist, I spent a lot of time building stuff for animals to play with and analyzing high-dimensional, fast time series data using statistical-machine learning methods. As such, I’ve gained an affinity for multi-scale methods like time-frequency analysis, an appreciation for all kinds of spatio-temporal pattern discovery, and a soft spot for generalized additive models. My general approach to problem solving is to study the “best” solutions in an adjacent domain, identify the simplest “good enough” path to a mvp, build it, break it and iterate. For some examples, check out my projects page.
